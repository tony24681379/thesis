Container becomes a popular technology since Docker has published in 2013.
Container technology has solved programmer and system maintainer when they have to deploy their applications in the servers.
They just need to build the container images, and the container images can run on everywhere they want.
Container technology also isolates each container environments just likes a single host machine.

In this paper, we not only migrate the Docker containers between two physical machines, but also migrate the Docker containers in the Docker Swarm cluster.
Furthermore, we enhance the high availability in the Docker Swarm cluster, the container can be set that checkpoint the container images to remote storage service; whenever the Docker Nodes are fail, the containers which run in the failed Docker Nodes will restore the newest checkpoint to the alive Docker Nodes as well.
