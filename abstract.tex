More and more software developers and information-technology professionals embrace the container technology, because it packs the required libraries and settings of software into a single image so that the deployment can be easily done anywhere without the issues of compatibility.  On top of single containers, orchestration tools are essential to automate the deployment and operation of complex systems that involve multiple containers on cluster of machines.  In this thesis, we present the idea of using checkpoint-and-restore technique to enhance the functionality of Docker Swarm, a state-of-art orchestration tool for Docker containers. Two major functions are focused:  high availability and migration.  We used multi-version checkpoints to enhance the availability of containers and investigated the optimal storage and performance for checkpoint-and-restore.  For migration, we leverage the shared storage and Docker Swarm's scheduler to make migration easier.  We also studied the possibility of live migration for our implementation.  Experiments show that {\color{red} 
pre-dump and track-memory will save about 10\% $ \sim $ 20\% container checkpoint frozen time and at least 200\% storage space.
