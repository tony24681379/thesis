Traditionally, people rely single supercomputer to calculate data or deploy their companies's application. Nowadays, cloud computing has been use wildly. People would like to use a lot of normal computers that gather them into a cluster to replace a supercomputer. More and more companies build their data centres or use cloud platforms to construct their business application.

Virtualization is a popular technology that is used wildly on cloud computing,  including virtual operating system, computer hardware platforms, storage device and computer network resources.
Virtual machine is a technology to emulate a particular computer like a real computer. It can partition a physical machine resource, such as CPU, memory, storage, and network.
A hypervisor uses execution to manage and share host physical machine hardware, it allows many different virtual machines isolated from each other.

Container is operating system level virtualization which runs as an isolated process in userspace on the host operating system and shares the same operation system kernel with other containers.
It provides kernel namespace such as PID,IPC, network, mount, and user namespace to isolate each container environment to host operation system.
In order to control hardware resource like CPU, memory, network, and disk I/O, container uses cgroups to limit each container resources.
Container doesn't have hypervisor to isolate with host operating system, therefore, it can offer better performance than virtual machine.
