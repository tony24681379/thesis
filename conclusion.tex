CRIU provides the container for dumping the checkpoint image and restoring it in the single host machine. In this thesis, we have purposed it to expand to Docker Swarm in the cluster.
To support high availability in the Docker Swarm cluster, we also use checkpoint ticker and restoration to recover last container work state in the other Swarm Node. In addition, We implement pre-dump checkpoint to reduce container frozen time and storage spaces; in many cases, it saves about 10\%~20\% frozen time and at least 200\% storage usage.

In the future, we plan to live migration the Docker container to support network applications' migration. In addition, we want to extend power consumption algorithm in Docker Swarm to enhance power consumption saving in the Docker Swarm cluster.
